## Dithering algorithms++
Somewhat less simple Processing implementations of some dithering algorithms
	
* Ordered dither
* Floyd-Steinberg
* Atkinson
* Random

Now contains: monochrome and color version with random or 3bit color palette
Most updating will happen in the color versions seeing as they can also act as monochrome


TODO:

make monochrome versions redundant and create a switch in colored versions to choose the palette (3bit, monochrome and random) (DONE for ordered color and atkinson color)
remove monochrome variants
add multithreading
add 2x2, 8x8 and other subversions of the sorting algoritms to sorted_color
