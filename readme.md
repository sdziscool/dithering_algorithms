## Dithering algorithms++
Somewhat less simple Processing implementations of some dithering algorithms
	
* Ordered dither
* Floyd-Steinberg
* Atkinson
* Random

Now contains: monochrome and color version with random or 3bit color palette
Most updating will happen in the color versions seeing as they can also act as monochrome


TODO:

make monochrome versions redundant and create a switch in colored versions to choose the palette (3bit, monochrome and random)
